## Identified Improvements
- Function 'analyze_self' is too long (96 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (97 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (107 lines)
- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here's an analysis of the provided Python code with actionable suggestions for improvement, focusing on the areas you specified:
- **1. Code Structure and Organization**
- *   **Suggestion 1: Break Down `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza.__init__` Method:**  This method is doing a lot. Initializing GitHub, loading state, setting up AI, defining domains, initializing performance metrics, and setting up components all in one method makes it hard to read and maintain.
- *   **Refactoring:**  Create dedicated methods for each of these major steps:
- def __init__(self):

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 471 cycles
