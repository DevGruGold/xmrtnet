- Okay, let's analyze the provided Python code for the `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` and suggest improvements.
- **Analysis & Suggestions:**
- 1. **Code Structure & Modularity:**
- *   **Issue:** The `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class is quite large and contains significant logic for GitHub interaction, AI integration, state management, domain-specific processing, and performance tracking. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
- *   **Suggestion:** Refactor the class into smaller, more specialized classes or functions. For example:
