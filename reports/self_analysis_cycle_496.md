- Okay, here are 3 actionable suggestions for improving the provided Python code, focusing on the areas you specified:
- **1. Code Structure and Organization: Break Down Large Class and Add More Functions to Reduce Complexity**
- *   **Problem:** The `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class is likely to become large and unwieldy as functionality is added.  The `domains` list is incomplete, suggesting there's more logic intended. Long methods make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain.
- *   **Suggestion:**
- *   **Refactor `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` into smaller, more focused classes or functions.** For example, consider creating separate classes for:

## Self-Learning Notes
