Cycle: 473

## Code Metrics
- Total lines: 621
- Functions analyzed: main
- Improvement opportunities: 9

## Identified Improvements
- Function 'analyze_self' is too long (96 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (97 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (107 lines)
- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here's an analysis of the Python code with suggestions for improvement:
- **1. Code Structure and Organization**
- *   **Suggestion 1: Break down the `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class into smaller, more focused classes/functions.** The class is becoming large and unwieldy.  Responsibilities like GitHub interaction, AI integration, state management, and performance tracking should be encapsulated in separate modules or classes.
- *   **Rationale:** Separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.  It reduces coupling and increases cohesion.  For example, create a `GitHubManager` class, an `AIManager` class (which handles Gemini integration), and a `StateManager` class. Consider also moving the performance metric tracking into a separate class for better encapsulation.
- *   **Implementation Example (Conceptual):**

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 472 cycles
- GitHub integration is working (0 commits made)
- AI capabilities: Gemini Active

## Next Actions
1. Implement identified code improvements
2. Continue tool discovery and integration
3. Enhance self-modification capabilities
4. Optimize performance based on metrics

## Evolution Status
Eliza is actively self-improving through:
- Continuous code analysis and refactoring
- Discovery and integration of new tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Adaptive learning from each cycle
