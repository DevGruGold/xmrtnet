- Okay, here are 3-5 actionable suggestions for improving the provided Python code, focusing on the areas you specified. This analysis assumes the "..." indicates further domain definitions and method implementations within the `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class.
- **1. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging:**
- *   **Problem:** The current error handling is relatively basic.  A general `Exception` is caught when trying to access the ecosystem repository, and only a print statement is used. This lacks detail for debugging and doesn't provide a robust recovery strategy.  Similarly, the `try...except` block for the Gemini import only prints to the console.
- *   **Suggestion:**
- *   **Implement more specific exception handling:** Catch specific exceptions like `github.GithubException` or `requests.exceptions.RequestException` for GitHub and network errors, respectively, when interacting with repositories. Also, catch `FileNotFoundError` or `JSONDecodeError` when loading state from a file (in `load_state`, not provided but implied).

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 496 cycles
- GitHub integration is working (0 commits made)
- Ecosystem integration: 0 commits to ecosystem repo
- AI capabilities: Gemini Active
- Uptime: Running since 2025-10-09T08:11:45.049867

## Next Actions
1. Implement identified code improvements
2. Continue tool discovery and integration
3. Enhance self-modification capabilities
4. Optimize performance based on metrics
5. Expand ecosystem repository improvements

## Evolution Status
Eliza is actively self-improving through:
- Continuous code analysis and refactoring
- Discovery and integration of new tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Adaptive learning from each cycle
- Dual-repository improvement (xmrtnet + XMRT-Ecosystem)
- 24/7 continuous operation mode
