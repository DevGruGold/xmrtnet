Cycle: 494

## Code Metrics
- Total lines: 621
- Functions analyzed: main
- Improvement opportunities: 9

## Identified Improvements
- Function 'analyze_self' is too long (96 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (97 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (107 lines)
- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here's an analysis of the Python code along with specific improvements, focusing on the requested areas:
- **1. Code Structure and Organization:**
- *   **Suggestion 1: Break down the `__init__` method into smaller, more focused methods.** The `__init__` method is quite long, which reduces readability and maintainability.  Instead of doing everything at once, delegate tasks to separate methods.
- class EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza:
- def __init__(self):
