- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, let's analyze the provided Python code and offer some actionable improvements.  Here are 5 specific suggestions:
- **1.  Improve Configuration Loading and Validation:**
- *   **Problem:** The current approach relies heavily on `os.getenv()` and manual checks, which can be prone to errors. The `ELIZA_MODE` default is a string, not a proper boolean.
- *   **Suggestion:** Use a dedicated configuration management library like `pydantic-settings` or `python-decouple`.  This allows you to define a clear data structure for your configuration, handle type conversions, validate values, and load from environment variables (and optionally other sources like `.env` files).  Specifically, enforce a fixed set of allowed values for `ELIZA_MODE` or use a boolean if that fits better.
- # Using pydantic-settings (install: pip install pydantic-settings)
