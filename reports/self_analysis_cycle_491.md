Cycle: 491

## Code Metrics
- Total lines: 621
- Functions analyzed: main
- Improvement opportunities: 9

## Identified Improvements
- Function 'analyze_self' is too long (96 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (97 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (107 lines)
- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, let's analyze the provided Python code and suggest some improvements focusing on code structure, performance, error handling, best practices, and potential issues.
- **Analysis & Suggestions:**
- 1.  **Code Structure & Modularity:**
- *   **Suggestion:**  Break down the `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class into smaller, more focused classes or functions.  This promotes the Single Responsibility Principle and improves readability and maintainability. For example, the AI integration, state management (loading/saving), GitHub interaction, and performance tracking could each be managed by separate classes or functions.
- *   **Rationale:**  The current class handles too many responsibilities.  By delegating these responsibilities, you reduce coupling and increase cohesion, making the code easier to understand, test, and modify.

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 490 cycles

4. Optimize performance based on metrics

## Evolution Status
Eliza is actively self-improving through:
- Continuous code analysis and refactoring
- Discovery and integration of new tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Adaptive learning from each cycle
