## Code Metrics
- Total lines: 621
- Functions analyzed: main
- Improvement opportunities: 9

## Identified Improvements
- Function 'analyze_self' is too long (96 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (97 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (107 lines)
- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here's an analysis of the provided Python code with specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:
- **1. Code Structure and Organization**
- *   **Suggestion:** Refactor the `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class into smaller, more manageable classes or functions.  Currently, the `__init__` method is quite large. Consider breaking out the AI integration setup, state management, and component initialization into separate methods or even separate classes. This will improve readability and maintainability.
- **Rationale:**  Large classes can become difficult to understand and debug.  By breaking down the responsibilities, you create a more modular and testable codebase.
- **Example:**
