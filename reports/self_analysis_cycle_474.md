- Okay, here are 5 actionable suggestions for improving the provided Python code, focusing on the areas you specified:
- **1.  Modularize the Code and Improve Readability:**
- *   **Problem:** The current structure is likely within a single file, leading to decreased readability and maintainability as it grows.  Mixing configuration, initialization, core logic, and potentially unrelated functionalities.
- *   **Suggestion:**  Refactor the code into multiple modules/classes. Create separate modules for:
- *   `config.py`: Handling environment variable loading and configuration.
