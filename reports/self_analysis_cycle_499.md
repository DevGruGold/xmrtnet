- Function 'analyze_ecosystem' is too long (101 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (100 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (159 lines)
- Found 5 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here are 3-5 specific, actionable suggestions to improve the provided Python code, focusing on the areas you requested:
- **1.  Improve Code Structure & Organization (Especially Long Imports & AI Setup):**
- *   **Problem:** The initial import block is excessively long and mixes standard library modules with third-party libraries. The `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza.__init__` method contains excessive logic and dependencies, especially regarding AI setup, making it difficult to read and maintain.
- *   **Solution:**
- 1.  **Refactor Imports:** Group imports by type (standard library, third-party, local).  Use `isort` to automatically sort and format imports. This improves readability.

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 498 cycles
- GitHub integration is working (0 commits made)
- Ecosystem integration: 0 commits to ecosystem repo
- AI capabilities: Gemini Active
- Uptime: Running since 2025-10-09T08:22:44.701435

## Next Actions
