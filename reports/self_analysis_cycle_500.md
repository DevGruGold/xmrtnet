- Okay, here are 3-5 specific, actionable suggestions to improve the provided Python code, focusing on code structure, performance, error handling, best practices, and potential issues:
- **1. Improve Code Structure and Configuration Loading with a Dedicated Class:**
- The current code has a mix of global configuration and initialization.  A dedicated configuration class would centralize this logic, improve readability, and make it easier to test.
- *   **Suggestion:** Create a `Config` class to handle environment variable loading and validation. This class can also implement default values and type conversions.
- class Config:
