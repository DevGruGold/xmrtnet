## Identified Improvements
- Function 'analyze_self' is too long (96 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (97 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (107 lines)
- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here's an analysis of the provided Python code with 5 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement.
- **Overall Assessment:**
- The code represents a complex system with multiple integrations (GitHub, Gemini, Email).  The structure is reasonably clear but could benefit from further modularization. Error handling is present but could be more robust. Performance tracking is a good start. The extensive configuration section at the beginning is good for adaptability.
- **Specific Suggestions:**
- 1.  **Modularize and Improve Code Organization (Structure/Organization):**

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 484 cycles
- GitHub integration is working (0 commits made)
- AI capabilities: Gemini Active

## Next Actions
1. Implement identified code improvements
2. Continue tool discovery and integration
3. Enhance self-modification capabilities
4. Optimize performance based on metrics

## Evolution Status
Eliza is actively self-improving through:
- Continuous code analysis and refactoring
- Discovery and integration of new tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Adaptive learning from each cycle
