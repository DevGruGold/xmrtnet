- Okay, here are 3-5 specific, actionable suggestions to improve the provided Python code, focusing on the areas you requested:
- **1. Improved Error Handling and Logging (especially around API calls and file I/O):**
- *   **Problem:** The current error handling is rudimentary. Exceptions in core functionality (like GitHub API calls, AI API calls, file operations, or even the initial setup of repos) can crash the entire script, especially in a `continuous_24_7` mode.  The "Ecosystem repository not available" error is printed but not handled. Other potential errors are likely going unlogged or unreported.
- *   **Suggestion:**  Implement more robust `try...except` blocks with specific exception types. Use a logging library (e.g., `logging`) instead of just `print` statements for errors.  This enables better debugging and monitoring.  For API calls, consider using libraries like `requests` with built-in retry mechanisms and exponential backoff to handle transient network issues.
- *   **Example:**

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 503 cycles
- GitHub integration is working (0 commits made)
- Ecosystem integration: 0 commits to ecosystem repo
- AI capabilities: Gemini Active
- Uptime: Running since 2025-10-09T16:08:07.820235

## Next Actions
1. Implement identified code improvements
2. Continue tool discovery and integration
3. Enhance self-modification capabilities
4. Optimize performance based on metrics
5. Expand ecosystem repository improvements

## Evolution Status
Eliza is actively self-improving through:
- Continuous code analysis and refactoring
- Discovery and integration of new tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Adaptive learning from each cycle
- Dual-repository improvement (xmrtnet + XMRT-Ecosystem)
- 24/7 continuous operation mode
