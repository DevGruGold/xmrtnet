Cycle: 468

## Code Metrics
- Total lines: 621
- Functions analyzed: main
- Improvement opportunities: 9

## Identified Improvements
- Function 'analyze_self' is too long (96 lines)
- Function 'discover_trending_tools' is too long (97 lines)
- Function 'run_complete_enhancement_cycle' is too long (107 lines)
- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here's an analysis of the provided Python code with actionable suggestions for improvement:
- **1. Code Structure and Organization:**
- *   **Suggestion 1: Modularize the Class:** The `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class is already becoming quite large.  Break it down into smaller, more manageable classes or functions based on responsibility.  For example:
- *   `GitHubHandler`:  Handles all GitHub interactions (loading/saving state, commits, etc.).
- *   `AIEngine`:  Encapsulates the Gemini/AI logic (if enabled).

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 467 cycles
- GitHub integration is working (0 commits made)
- AI capabilities: Gemini Active

## Next Actions
1. Implement identified code improvements
2. Continue tool discovery and integration
3. Enhance self-modification capabilities
4. Optimize performance based on metrics

## Evolution Status
Eliza is actively self-improving through:
- Continuous code analysis and refactoring
- Discovery and integration of new tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Adaptive learning from each cycle
