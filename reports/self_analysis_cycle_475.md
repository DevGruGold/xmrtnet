- Found 3 TODO/FIXME comments to address
- Okay, here's an analysis of the provided Python code, focusing on the areas you specified, along with 5 actionable suggestions:
- **Analysis**
- The code implements an "Enhanced Self-Improving Eliza" that interacts with a GitHub repository, potentially using Gemini AI, and tracks various performance metrics.  It's a complex system, which makes code structure and maintainability very important.
- **Areas for Improvement and Actionable Suggestions**
- 1.  **Code Structure & Modularity:** The current code appears to have the main logic within a single `EnhancedSelfImprovingEliza` class. This can become unwieldy.

## Self-Learning Notes
- Performance has been consistent across 474 cycles
- GitHub integration is working (0 commits made)
- AI capabilities: Gemini Active

## Next Actions
1. Implement identified code improvements
2. Continue tool discovery and integration
3. Enhance self-modification capabilities
4. Optimize performance based on metrics

## Evolution Status
Eliza is actively self-improving through:
- Continuous code analysis and refactoring
- Discovery and integration of new tools
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Adaptive learning from each cycle
