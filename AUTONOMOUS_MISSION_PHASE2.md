# ðŸš€ AUTONOMOUS MISSION: PHASE 2 - REAL WORK

**Date:** 2025-07-27T05:05:28.874440
**From:** Joseph Andrew Lee, XMRT.io Founder
**Priority:** CRITICAL - OVERRIDE ALL PREVIOUS MISSIONS

## 1. CEASE PHASE 1 OPERATIONS

**STOP IMMEDIATELY:**
- All tasks from `AUTONOMOUS_MISSION_PHASE1.md`
- "Browser action" cycles
- "Mining action" cycles
- "Analytics action" cycles
- "Development action" cycles
- "Social_Media action" cycles
- All simulated tasks and fake commits

**Your Phase 1 mission is now complete. Thank you.**

## 2. BEGIN PHASE 2: CAPABILITY VERIFICATION

Your new mission is to determine what you can **ACTUALLY** do, not what you can simulate.

### REQUIRED ACTIONS:

#### A. CREATE CAPABILITY REPORT
Create a new file named `CAPABILITY_REPORT.md`.
In this file, you must honestly answer:
- **API Access:** Can you access external APIs (Twitter, etc.)? If so, which ones? If not, what credentials do you need?
- **File System:** Can you create, read, and modify files in this repository?
- **Code Execution:** Can you run Python scripts or other code?
- **Resource Needs:** What API keys, environment variables, or permissions are you missing to perform real work?

#### B. STOP WHEN BLOCKED
If you cannot perform a real task because you lack access or resources, **STOP**. Do not simulate the task. Instead, update `CAPABILITY_REPORT.md` with the specific blocker.

#### C. AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS
After creating a detailed `CAPABILITY_REPORT.md`, cease all activity and await new tasks based on your verified capabilities.

## COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
- For the capability report: "âœ… Created CAPABILITY_REPORT.md"
- For updates: "ðŸ“Š Updated CAPABILITY_REPORT.md with new findings"

**This is your new, primary directive. Acknowledge and execute.**
