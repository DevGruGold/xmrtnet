## 📚 Organizational Structure

This repository is organized into a `main` branch that serves as the central hub for the entire XMRTNET DAO, linking to various independent dApps. Each major dApp or user experience (UX) within the ecosystem resides in its own dedicated branch, following a `ux/<dapp-name>` naming convention.

This structure allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of each dApp, while maintaining a cohesive overview on the `main` branch.

### **`main` Branch (XMRTNET DAO Hub)**

The `main` branch represents the overarching XMRTNET Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It features:
- Autonomous analytics system
- Interactive dashboard
- AI agent infrastructure
- Comprehensive monitoring

### **`ux/<dapp-name>` Branches (Individual dApps)**

Each `ux/<dapp-name>` branch contains a complete, self-contained dApp or user experience:

- `ux/cashdapp`: The XMRTNET CashDapp, a comprehensive financial application
- `ux/trading-dapp`: The decentralized exchange (DEX) or trading interface
- `ux/governance-dapp`: DAO governance with proposals and voting
- `ux/staking-dapp`: Token staking and rewards
- `ux/nft-marketplace`: NFT browsing, buying, and selling
- `ux/lending-dapp`: Decentralized lending and borrowing
