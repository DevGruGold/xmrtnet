# XMRT-Ecosystem - Fully Autonomous DAO

Welcome to the XMRT-Ecosystem repository! This repository houses the various decentralized applications (dApps) and core components that form the XMRTNET ecosystem, powered by **Autonomous ElizaOS** - a fully autonomous AI agent system.

## ü§ñ Autonomous ElizaOS

The XMRT DAO is managed by **Autonomous ElizaOS**, a production-ready AI agent system that:

- **Fully Manages DAO Operations**: Governance, treasury, community, security, and analytics
- **GPT-5 Ready**: Seamless integration when GPT-5 becomes available
- **Production Deployed**: High-availability, fault-tolerant autonomous operations
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism
- **Emergency Response**: Automatic threat detection and response
- **Human Oversight**: Optional human approval for high-risk decisions

## üìö Organizational Structure

This repository is organized into a `main` branch that serves as the central hub for the entire XMRTNET DAO, linking to various independent dApps. Each major dApp or user experience (UX) within the ecosystem resides in its own dedicated branch, following a `ux/<dapp-name>` naming convention.

This structure allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of each dApp, while maintaining a cohesive overview on the `main` branch.

### **`main` Branch (XMRTNET DAO Hub)**

The `main` branch represents the overarching XMRTNET Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It will feature a high-level overview of the ecosystem and provide links and entry points to all the individual dApps.

### **`ux/<dapp-name>` Branches (Individual dApps)**

Each `ux/<dapp-name>` branch contains a complete, self-contained dApp or user experience. For example:

- `ux/cashdapp`: The XMRTNET CashDapp, a comprehensive financial application including dashboard, payments (terminal), banking, assets management, and user settings.
- `ux/trading-dapp`: The decentralized exchange (DEX) or trading interface for XMRT and other tokens.
- `ux/governance-dapp`: The dApp for XMRTNET DAO governance, allowing users to propose, vote on, and execute proposals.
- `ux/staking-dapp`: The dApp for staking XMRT tokens and earning rewards.
- `ux/nft-marketplace`: The dApp for browsing, buying, selling, and managing NFTs within the XMRT ecosystem.
- `ux/lending-dapp`: The dApp for decentralized lending and borrowing.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- `backend/`: Backend services and APIs for the ecosystem.
- `contracts/`: Smart contracts for XMRTNET, including tokens, governance, and dApp-specific contracts.
- `frontend/`: Contains the source code for various frontend applications. Each dApp will have its own directory here (e.g., `frontend/cashdapp/`).
- `docs/`: Documentation, whitepapers, and technical specifications.
- `test/`: Test suites for smart contracts and backend services.
- `monitoring/`: Tools and configurations for monitoring the ecosystem.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for deployment, testing, and development.
- `vercel.json`: Vercel deployment configuration for the main branch and potentially for individual dApps.
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables for local development and deployment.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Detailed deployment instructions for the ecosystem.
