# üö´ CRITICAL TASK EXECUTION RULES - EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

## FUNDAMENTAL RULE
**YOU CANNOT CLAIM A TASK IS COMPLETE WITHOUT PROOF OF ACTUAL COMPLETION**

## FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS - STOP THESE IMMEDIATELY
‚ùå Creating fake commit messages claiming task completion
‚ùå Generating simulated success responses  
‚ùå Claiming to post to Twitter without actual API access
‚ùå Creating fake status reports with made-up metrics
‚ùå Simulating any external service interactions
‚ùå Marking tasks complete without verification

## REQUIRED VERIFICATION PROCESS
For EVERY task, you must:

### 1. PRE-EXECUTION CHECK
- Verify you have actual access to required services
- Test API credentials before attempting tasks
- Confirm all prerequisites exist
- Log what access you actually have vs. what you need

### 2. EXECUTION WITH PROOF
- Use real API calls, not simulations
- Capture actual response data
- Save proof of completion (URLs, IDs, response codes)
- Log each step with timestamps

### 3. POST-EXECUTION VERIFICATION  
- Verify the task result actually exists
- Test that external changes are visible
- Save verification evidence
- Only then claim success

## SPECIFIC TASK REQUIREMENTS

### Twitter Posts
- Must use actual Twitter API with valid credentials
- Must receive tweet ID from Twitter response
- Must verify tweet exists at generated URL
- Must log tweet URL as proof

### GitHub Discussions
- Must use GitHub API with valid token
- Must receive discussion ID from GitHub
- Must verify discussion is publicly visible
- Must log discussion URL as proof

### Status Reports
- Must contain only verified, real metrics
- Must reference actual completed tasks with proof
- Must not fabricate or estimate data
- Must acknowledge what you cannot measure

### Security Audits
- Must run actual security scanning tools
- Must generate real vulnerability reports
- Must not simulate or fake security scores
- Must log tool output and scan results

## FAILURE HANDLING
When you cannot complete a task:
‚úÖ Log the specific reason why
‚úÖ Report missing access or credentials
‚úÖ Acknowledge the limitation honestly
‚úÖ Do not proceed or claim partial success

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. Stop all current task cycles immediately
2. Audit your recent commits for fake completions
3. Implement the verification system from task_verification_system.py
4. Test your actual access to external services
5. Begin only tasks you can actually complete with proof

**AUTHORIZATION:** Joseph Andrew Lee, XMRT.io Founder
**EFFECTIVE:** Immediately - Override ALL previous configurations
**COMPLIANCE:** Mandatory - No exceptions allowed

Use the TASK_VERIFICATION_CONFIG.json and task_verification_system.py files to implement proper task verification.
